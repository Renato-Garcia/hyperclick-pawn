## Usage
`<cmd+click>` on `#include <file>` directive to jump directly to that file.
You MUST configure your include directory in package settings before use it.

## Known Issues
* There's no path checks, so you need to configure you path `C:\Pawn\MyIncludes` instead of `C:\Pawn\MyIncludes\`.

## Road Map
* Learn how to create a package properly.
* Path checks to avoid issues.
* Go To Definition feature-like for variables and functions, maybe??.
